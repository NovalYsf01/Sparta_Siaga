# SPARTA SIAGA — DEVICE PERMISSIONS & NOTIFICATION UX CORRECTIVE REPORT

## Executive Summary
This report summarizes the corrective UX hardening applied to device permissions (Camera & Location) and the global toast notification system in the SPARTA SIAGA application. The implementation ensures enterprise-grade visual presentation and resilient, understandable permission-handling for sensitive hardware access.

## Identified Issues
1. **Notification UX Mismatch:** The default `sonner` toast was visually bulky, overly colorful (`richColors`), and lacked integration with the application's clean, enterprise dark-mode aesthetic.
2. **Camera Permission Crash:** `CameraCapture` attempted immediate hardware access upon rendering without user intent, resulting in generic "Kamera Gagal" or "Permission denied" errors.
3. **No Centralized Device Diagnostics:** Users could not proactively check or request location/camera access prior to initiating an incident workflow.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enterprise Toast Refinement (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Stripped `richColors` configuration.
- Configured custom `classNames` in `<Toaster />` to deliver a neutral surface (white in light mode, slate-900 in dark mode) with colored icon accents.
- Realigned the close button for better accessibility and integration within the toast container.
- Added a subtle drop shadow to prevent visual conflation with page content.

### 2. Camera Pre-Permission UX & Fallback (`components/incident/camera-capture.tsx`)
- **Idle State:** Camera no longer auto-initializes. Replaced with an informative "Gunakan Kamera" prompt explaining why the permission is needed.
- **Manual Triggers:** Added distinct "Aktifkan Kamera" (primary) and "Unggah Foto" (secondary fallback) actions.
- **Error Interpretation:** Mapped raw `getUserMedia` errors (e.g., `NotAllowedError`, `NotFoundError`, `NotReadableError`) to human-readable instructions explaining how to recover.
- **Watermark Persistence:** The "Unggah Foto" fallback processes uploaded files identically to live captures by drawing the SPARTA SIAGA watermark onto the image buffer before submission.

### 3. Centralized Device Settings (`app/(siaga)/settings/page.tsx`)
- Created a new **"Perangkat & Izin Akses"** section.
- Added live permission status polling using `navigator.permissions.query` for both `camera` and `geolocation`.
- Implemented an interactive "Uji Lokasi" function that verifies GPS acquisition and displays accurate lat/long coordinates or a contextual error toast.
- Added an explicit note explaining that "Akses Diblokir" requires manual resolution via browser settings, avoiding false promises of programmatic unblocking.

## Verification
- Type-checking (`npx tsc --noEmit`) and linting (`npm run lint`) pass without blockers (linting errors were fixed).
- **Note:** Automated browser verification via subagent was blocked due to a 503 capacity error. Manual visual verification is recommended prior to merge.
